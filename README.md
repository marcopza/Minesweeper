# Minesweeper
JavaFX based minesweeper.
Left click will open the selected box. You may do this by inserting the column and row number and pressing the select button.
Right click will "flag" the box placing an exclamation mark.
You may click on the clue button but this only selects non-zero boxes, therefore it is impossible to win with only pressing clues.
Pressing the soution button displays the solution for the current board.
Have fun!
